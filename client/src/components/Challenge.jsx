          What if electronic devices were grown instead of manufactured? What if they acted more like organisms that could be composted, or perhaps heal themselves when damaged? What if they could provide benefits to the user or their surroundings? What new materials could be utilised for consumer electronics of the futureâ€”from phones and speakers to laptops and more? Invent and apply the materials of the future.
