          In pursuit of our own technological advancement, we have created a rift between humanity and nature.
          For the first time in our planetâ€™s history, the anthropomass - the mass of human-made goods - now outweighs the biomass - the mass of all living things. Humanity has rapidly unraveled what has taken nature billions of years of evolution to create, resulting in a threat to the continued viability of life on Earth. 
        </p>

        <p>
          In response to this crisis, ECOLAB proposes the creation of design solutions by, for, and with nature while advancing humanity. The goal of ECOLAB is to create a community of collaboration across disciplines, and to build meaningful public discussion about bio-design and its uses. To that end, designers are empowered to dream up new, dynamic design possibilities, where products and structures can grow, heal, and adapt.
