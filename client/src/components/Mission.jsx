        In pursuit of our own technological advancement, humanity has rapidly unravelled what has taken nature billions of years of evolution to create. For the first time in our planetâ€™s history, the anthropomass - the mass of human-made goods - now outweighs the biomass - the mass of all living things. In response to this rift between humanity and nature, Ecolab aims to seed a new generation of climate conscious thinkers to create innovative design solutions by, for, and with nature while advancing humanity. Through a selection of prompts, designers are encouraged to dream up new, dynamic design possibilities, where products and structures can grow, heal, and adapt.
